Built a chat-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using the LLaMA 3.2 model (via Ollama) to deliver real-time insights from the U.S. Federal Register. The system first fetches and stores data from the Federal Register API into a MySQL database. Tool functions with parameterized SQL queries are registered with the LLM. When a user asks a question, the LLM selects the appropriate tool function, executes the SQL query on the database, receives the results, and generates a summarized, user-friendly response.
